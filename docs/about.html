                        Hi, I'm self-taught web developer with a great passion
                        for programming. My primary focus on front-end is
                        Javascript, ES6, React, HTML, CSS, Sass, and on back-end
                        I have experience with technologies like NodeJS, MongoDB
                        and Express, interested in building a career as a
                        Full-Stack Developer.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="info info-1">
                    <h3>About the space...</h3>
                    <p>
                        Web technologies are evolving at such a fast rate, I
                        think its really exciting beeing in this space. I really
                        like Javascript, because it has such a large community
                        and with technologies like node, bringing JS to the
                        server side really makes things a lot easier for full
                        stack developers. Front-end libraries, frameworks, and
                        tools like npm, webpack, eslint, babel and many others
                        are constantly getting better and easier to work with.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="info info-2">
                    <h3>Now and Future...</h3>
                    <p>
                        I got really interested in web development when I
                        enrolled in CS50 course a couple of years ago. It was a
                        brief intro to coding in C, python, algorithms and data
                        structures. Really good stuff, I would definitely
                        recommend it. Currently building some projects with
                        ReactJS, and expanding my knowledge about back-end
                        Node\Express\MongoDB. Please check my github repo if you
                        are interested to see some of the projects that I worked
                        on.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Early days...</h3>
                    <p>
                        In early days and during dot-com bubble, I got
                        interested in IT. I worked in the tech-field industry
                        for many years as IT support techician, PC desktop and
                        laptop service technician, RMA Specialist and also as a
                        procurement agent for various consumer electronics
                        overseas.
