				<p>Hi, I am self-taught web developer. I am building a career focused on MERN Full Stack Web Development, mostly working with Javascript, core CSS and HTML, MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js</p>

				<h3>Now and Future...</h3>
				<p>I got really interested in web development when I enrolled in CS50 course a couple of years ago. It was a brief intro to coding in C, python, algorithms and data structures. Really good stuff, I would definitely recommend it. Currently building some projects and getting into front-end libraries like ReactJS, and back-end Node\Express\MongoDB. Please check my github repo if you are interested to see some of the projects that I worked on.</p>

				<h3>China tech buzz...</h3>
				<p>As a rapidly growing tech hub, China was a really interesting place to be, so I decided to spend a couple of years over there. Learning the language really helped me in understanding how stuff works over there, and I was lucky to see and experience all the tech buzz in one of the fastest growing tech hubs Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Foshan.</p>

			<div class="info info-3">
				<h3>Early days...</h3>
				<p>In early days and during dot-com bubble, I got interested in computer hardware and networks, I worked as as Tech support in the field for many years. That really got me interested in technology, hardware and software solutions.</p>
