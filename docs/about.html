					<p>
						Hi, I am self-taught web developer, mostly working with Javascript,
						core CSS and HTML. Currently, my focus is on Full Stack Web
						Development, I'm learning React, and exploring back-end with
						MongoDB, Express, and Node.js.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="info info-1">
					<h3>About the space...</h3>
					<p>
						Web technologies are evolving at such a fast rate, I think its
						really exciting beeing in this space. I really like Javascript,
						because it has such a large community and with technologies like
						node, bringing JS to the server side really makes things a lot
						easier for full stack developers. Front-end libraries, frameworks,
						and tools like npm, webpack, eslint, babel and many others are
						constantly getting better and easier to work with.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="info info-2">
					<h3>Now and Future...</h3>
					<p>
						I got really interested in web development when I enrolled in CS50
						course a couple of years ago. It was a brief intro to coding in C,
						python, algorithms and data structures. Really good stuff, I would
						definitely recommend it. Currently building some projects and
						getting into front-end libraries like ReactJS, and back-end
						Node\Express\MongoDB. Please check my github repo if you are
						interested to see some of the projects that I worked on.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="info info-3">
					<h3>Early days...</h3>
					<p>
						In early days and during dot-com bubble, I got interested in
						computer hardware and networks, I worked as as Tech support in the
						field for many years. That really got me interested in technology,
						hardware and software solutions.
					</p>
